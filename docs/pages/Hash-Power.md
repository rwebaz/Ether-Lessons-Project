## Hash Defined

> **Hint**. {{ page.hint }}

An example of a *hash* is an Ethereum network public address pre-fixed by the characters `0x`, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
ETH: 0x65E1d7699af76717d131C3564f4378D871158Bf6
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. The above public address in the form of a pre-fixed *hash* can be used as a receptacle for  `ether` "in the wild" or over the Ethereum network.
