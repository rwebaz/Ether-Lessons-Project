# Hash Power

The *hashing power* of the Bitcoin network now exceeds ten (10) **T** *hash-per-second*.

## Hash Defined

Hash are simply very long resultant random chains of characters that are generated by the **SHA 256** algorithm.

An example of a *hash* is an Ethereum network public address pre-fixed by the characters `0x`, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
ETH: 0x65E1d7699af76717d131C3564f4378D871158Bf6
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. The above public address in the form of a pre-fixed *hash* can be used as a receptacle for  `ether` "in the wild" or over the Ethereum network.

## Last Subtitle

Place the introducing line of text ie.) the 'tagline' here ...

```liquid
{% raw %}
Enjoy the successful output!
{% endraw %}
```
