## The Ethereum Platform

> **Hint**. {{ page.hint }}

This simple beginner’s guide is to help those just coming to **Ethereum** for the first time.

1. The **Ethereum** platform is a major advancement for humankind.

1. The **Ethereum** platform empowers humans to form safe and secure digital agreements with each other.

1. The **Ethereum** platform allows people to truly own and control their own money.

1. The **Ethereum** platform allows people to protect their internet money from corruption.

1. The **Ethereum** platform allows people to better harness the elegant and incredible nature of cryptography.

1. The **Ethereum** platform will change everything.

1. The **Ethereum** platform will change the way we build things.

1. The **Ethereum** platform will change the way we create, communicate, and control our own futures.

Therefore, do NOT be afraid of **Ethereum**.

But, rather embrace **Ethereum** and the **Ethereum** platform.

## Transact Me

To start, the **Ethereum** platform is a transaction system.

Anyone can use the **Ethereum** platform to send and receive internet money.

**Ether** is the crypto currency of choice that drives the block chain at the **Ethereum** platform.

To use the **Ethereum** platform, a transactor must convert their existing currency to **Ether** in a sufficient amount necessary to complete their transaction.

## Accounts

An account at the **Ethereum** platform is composed of a "key-value" pair.

The "key" is the address and the "value" is called a **hash**.

**Note**. An account at the **Ethereum** platform may send and receive **Ether**.

**Ether**, you may recall, is the crypto currency of choice that drives the block chain at the **Ethereum** platform.

## Smart Contracts

A smart contract is a block of computer code that executes at least once in order to be added to the block-chain.

**Note**. A smart contract at the **Ethereum** platform may send and receive **Ether**, too.

**Ether**, you may recall, is the crypto currency of choice that drives the block chain at the **Ethereum** platform.

## Sending Transactions

To send a transaction over the **Ethereum** platform, the transactor and transactee are required to negotiate a small amount of **Ether**.

Commonly known as "Contract Gas", the **Ether** agreed upon will be credited to the **Miner** who successfully forges the block that completes your transaction.

Generally, the more **Contract Gas** you include in your transaction, the faster your transaction will be processed.

Does that sound fair?

## Digital Wallets

An **Ether** wallet comes in many flavors.

Only use Ethereum on safe/fresh/clean and up-to-date secured computers.

Preferably use iOS/Linux, preferably use an iPhone over Android.

Preferably don’t browse on your safe devices you use for Ethereum related things.

HTTPS or nothing.

Use an Ad Blocker.

Public Wifi is unsafe.

Use a popular VPN.

Read everything, read it slowly and read it carefully.

Try to learn and understand as much as you can.

e) Join the community, ask questions, stay very skeptical of everything, and don’t rush any purchases or transactions ever.

f) There are thousands of spam, spoofing, hacking and unsafe services and contracts trying to steal your precious Ether.

Ask community leaders and experts for opinions, and trusted options or about services/websites you’re unsure about.

Don’t ever be shy, in most cases try to use what everyone else is using and what the community is comfortable with.

g) Once you send Ether or Tokens, think of it as a final sale transaction.

You will never get it back if a thief or poorly constructed contract has it.

This also goes for poorly backed up accounts.

h) Follow the law.

Remember to consult with tax professionals (i.e. CPAs) and consult with proper legal counsel before acquiring or transferring any Ethereum tokens or assets.

Also know that things are bound to change and change often in the space.

Don’t get comfortable, keep probing the space for new ideas, practices and ways to keep your Ether and digital assets safe.

To get you familiar with some basic concepts fast, here are some basics.

## Blockchain and Miners

When transactions are sent, they get bunched up into blocks one after the other, we call this bunching of transactions into blocks the “Blockchain”.

Each block contains a set of processed and valid transactions.

Blocks are created one after the other by transaction verifiers called Miners (like Gold Miners).

Miners can get rewards for processing transactions.

**Note**. Both the **Ethereum** platform and the **Bitcoin** platform have their own type of block chains.

Different technically, but conceptually alike somewhat in many ways, though every day the divergence between the **Ethereum** platform and the **Bitcoin** platform grows exponentially.

## Accounts and Keys

If you want to send or receive either **Ether** or real Tokens on the Ethereum platform ...

You will need an account.

## Public Addresses

All **Ethereum** platform accounts ( and, contracts ) have a public address.

Public addresses at the **Ethereum** platform are assembled in "Hex" format and look like a scrambled string of characters comprised of the letters (A) through (F), and the numbers zero (0) through nine (9), as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
0x88d221E36A68B19dd8aD1a5d4c21bE41a6d47b57
{% endraw %}
```

## Private Key

All **Ethereum** platform accounts also possess a **Private Key**.

The private key allows the owner of the account to send Ether ( or, Tokens ) to and from his or her public address.

An example of a hexadecimal private key looks like the following string of characters ...

```liquid
{% raw %}
0xa1f731db77f4ec6eb71c134ae545449a2d5a1d76458458b6d8d5751c10aac306
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. The **Private Key** is a little bit longer than the **Public Address**, heh?

## Key To The Castle

Think of your **Private Key** as the key to your crypto castle.

Any person who has the **Private Key** can access all or part of the stored **Ether**, the Tokens, if any, and any other digital asset stored at the account's public address.

Therefore, keep-a your **Private Key** safe! 

## Seed Phrases

**Seeds** are special phrases that can be used in combination with a passphrase to call a **Private Key** from deep storage. 

**Seed Phrases** are easier to write down and record than the long hexadecimals used in your **Private Key** and  **Public Address**.

The construction of a **Seed Phrase** uses a range of words from three (3) to twenty-four (24).

If any software asks you to write one down, then write it down like it was your last will and testament.

If you lose the **Seed** or passphrase, or if you record either incorrectly, you can lose all your funds forever.

If someone steals or copies your **Seed Phrases**, they will potentially also capture all of your **Ether**.

## Oops

To avoid sending your **Ether**, or Tokens to the wrong **Public Address** ...

Always, always scan and double check the first (1st) and the last five (5) to seven (7) "hex" digits of the **Public Address** ( at a minimum ) that you are sending your **Ether** to.

Also, scan and double check the transaction amount to make sure the number of **Ether** being sent is correct.

Always, always, always ...

Compare and check all details at least twice, or maybe even three times to avoid error.

## Wei

The base unit of an **Ether** crypto coin is called a *Wei* aka *Wei Dai*.

There are eighteen (18) decimal places of Wei in a single **Ether** coin.

Therefore, one (1) **Ether** coin equals `1000000000000000000` Wei.

## Finney

More to come ...

## Shannon

More to come ...

## Gwei

More to come ...

Real Tokens can be denominated in all different kinds of units.

Some real Tokens have no decimal places ie.) One (1) real Token is always One (1) real Token

While other real Tokens can have denominations and decimal places similar to **Ether** ie.) One (1) real Token = Eighteen (18) decimal places of Token ...

When sending real Tokens, you will generally not need to send any “value” of **Ether**.

However, you will be required to pay a small amount of **Ether** for gas in order to send the transaction and to pay the Miner.

## Solidity

**Solidity** is a computer language all **Ethereum** platform account owners may use to code their **Smart Contract**  transactions, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
pragma solidity 0.4.13;
contract HelloWorld { 
 function saySomething() returns (string message) { return “Hello World!”; }
}
{% endraw %}
```

The **Ethereum** platform takes the contract code and executes its functions by converting the **Solidity** code to **Ethereum Virtual Machine** aka **EVA** code, as follows:

```liquid
{% raw %}
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
{% endraw %}
```

**Note**. Other **Ethereum** platform **Smart Contracts** as well as the owners of other **Ethereum** platform accounts may call the methods of your creation to calculate and render a different result by passing in different variables.

## Test Nets

The **Ethereum** platform has many, multiple sub-networks.

We call these sub-networks “test networks”, or **Test Nets** for short.

Developers use these networks to test and build live contracts and services on the internet before going to the main network.

The main **Ethereum** platform network is called the *Main Net*.

While the most common test networks are called:

“Ropsten”,

“Rinkeby”, and

“Kovan”.

### Faucet Coins

The fake **Ether** and fake Tokens used on test networks are generally worthless.

They are to be used for testing purposes only.

Many test networks do have something called a “faucet”.

This is where developers and users can get free test **Ether** to be used for that test network only.

When using **Ethereum** platform wallets like "Meta Mask" ...

Remember to be on a test network when testing your programs.

**Note**. When executing **Smart Contracts** LIVE, you will be on the **Main Net** of the **Ethereum** platform.

## Blockchain Explorer

A great way to view all block, transaction, and account information for each network is to visit https://etherscan.io/

## decentralized Apps

A  **decentralized App** aka **dApp** is an application that is made in part from one or more **Ethereum** platform **Smart Contracts**.

Many **dApps** are very lightweight.

They are browser based apps traditionally made with familiar Html5 and Css and Javascript.

These "fancy webpages for contracts" interact with specific other **Smart Contracts** on one or many of the **Ethereum** platform networks.

You can think of **decentralized Apps** as being the pretty faces to **Smart Contracts**.

## Ether aka Contract Gas

You can acquire **Ether** via:

a) using an online exchange,

b) a person or service sending it to you,

c) mining it with very expensive and powerful computers.

## Getting Started

To start tooling around the Ethereum platform, try **MyEtherWallet** to create, backup and use your first **Ethereum** platform wallet (huzza!):

C=> [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com){:title="Click to Visit the ..."}{:target="_blank"}

Then install **MetaMask** in your Chrome browser in order to enable your browser with the **Ethereum** platform and the new *Web 3.0 Internet*.

**MetaMask** is also an **Ethereum** wallet that can be used on the **Ethereum** platform.

C=> [MetaMask](https://metamask.io){:title="Click to Visit the ..."}{:target="_blank"}

And, can also be used with the above **MyEtherWallet**, among other options.

## Author Caveats

Please always remember, articles can be hacked, too!

So, please watch where the links you click ultimately go.

And, only trust your real **Ether** or real Tokens to your "hard" wallet, or "paper" wallet.

Your "soft" wallet should only be used to transact business over the Ethereum platform ...

NOT as a permanent place of storage for oodles of **Ether**.

Always double check the links that you click on with other sources.

( as I have done here ;-)

### Token Silence

Also use a hardware wallet like **Ledger S Nano** or **Trezor**

- Remember to always properly backup all keys and seeds like your life depends on it

- Do NOT keep large amounts of **Ether** or real Tokens on ANY exchanges or 3rd party service

- Do NOT send or store **Ether** or real Tokens in anything you don’t fully understand

- **Note**. Most *Initial Coin Offerings*, or **ICO** are politely ... BS!

- Remember: you are your own bank, accountant, security team and analyst!

- Be diligent with the **ICOs** you encounter out there in the wild.

- This means it’s all up to you to make the right choices and to secure your money!

**Note**, **Ledger S Nano** and **Trezor** all have their own softwares for managing **Ether** and their other assets.

## Author Profile

My journey with **Ethereum** has been filled with amazing people, talent, ideas and projects.

I hope that in writing this guide you will learn more about the technology of the **Ethereum** platform.

And, have great success as a user of this new form of technology.

### Beginner Guide

This beginners guide is the start of a larger wallet handling git book that will be coming out sometime after this article.

The book will outline detailed wallet setup instructions, options, tips and tricks to handling Ether and digital assets.

It will get complex, which is why beginners guides and primers like this are so important.

A special thanks to all those who provided feedback and helped out with this and other articles.
