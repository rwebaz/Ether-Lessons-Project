This is what the Wallet’s overview screen looks like.

At the top of your Wallet overview screen, you’ll see the info related to the sync status of your node.

If the node has stopped syncing (e.g. zero peers or block number not changing), try re-starting the Wallet app or wait for some time.

Under Accounts, you can see the number of accounts and Ether balance in every account.

Go inside the ‘MAIN ACCOUNT’.
