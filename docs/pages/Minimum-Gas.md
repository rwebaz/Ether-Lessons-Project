## Op Codes

The minimum amount of `gas` required by the **Ethereum** network to execute a *smart contract* ...

That will transfer funds ...

Is currently set at twenty-one thousand (21,000) `gas` units plus the value of all other resident *op-code* functions used by your contract, if any.

The fee schedule per *op-code* expressed in units of `gas` is set annually by the directors of the **Ethereum** foundation and is also subject to change.

**Note**. All *smart contracts* executed over at the **Ethereum** network must be written in **Solidity**, the default **Ethereum** network development language.

### EVM

The (.sol) files are then compiled into byte-code for the *Ethereum Virtual Machine*, or **EVM** to work upon.

So, to sum ...

If you wish to send `ether` from one account to another over the **Ethereum** network, you will have to pay a current fee of at least twenty-one thousand (21,000) `gas` units.

Therefore, when figuring out how much `ether` to send from one account to the other, you must also account for the expected override snipped by the **Ethereum** network to process your transaction based on the complexity of your *smart contract*.

### Gas Prices

If we can calculate the number of `gas` units our *smart contract* will consume when executing over the **Ethereum** network ...

Then, given the current price of `gas` over at the **Ethereum** network we should be able to calculate the `gas` *cost* of our contract, as well.

How much *Giga-wei*, or `gwei` of gas are you willing to spend?

Try scoping out the current action of the **Ethereum** network by viewing the *Ethereum Network Dashboard* over at [Ether Stats dot net](https://www.ethstats.net/){:title="Click to Visit the Ethereum Network Dashboard at Ether Stats dot net"}{:target="_blank"}.

In column two of the *Ethereum Network Dashboard* under the subtitle '**Uncles**' you will find the current price of `gas` at the **Ethereum** network.

Currently, the dashboard shows a price of `gas` at the **Ethereum** network equal to twenty (20) `gwei`.

So, if your *smart contract* is simple, and only requires the sending of `ether` from one account to another ...

Then you may currently expect to pay twenty (20) `gwei` per *gas unit*.

And, it takes twenty-one thousand (21,000) `gas` units just to execute a transfer of `ether` from one account to another.

Hmmmmm ...

Twenty-one thousand (21,000) `gas` units times twenty (20) `gwei` per *gas unit* equals ...

420,000 `gwei`, or *Giga-wei*.

Now, a `wei` is the smallest denomination that an official (ETH) coin can be broken into.

In fact, there are 1,000 *zillion* `wei` per (ETH) coin!

### Convert

According to the [Ethereum Converter](https://etherconverter.online/){:title="Click to Visit the Ethereum Converter Online"}{:target="_blank"}, there are one-million (1,000,000,000) `wei` in a `gwei`, or *Giga-wei*.

From our previous calculation, we need four-hundred and twenty thousand (420,000) `gwei`, or *Giga-wei* just to transfer funds over the **Ethereum** network.

That's four-hundred and twenty thousand million `wei`!

Or, 420 billion as we say here in America (there are a thousand million in one billion).

```liquid
{% raw %}
420,000,000,000
{% endraw %}
```

Now, if I knew the price of one `wei` given there are 1,000 *zillion* `wei` in one `ether` coin, or (ETH) ...

Then, I could calculate the cost of running my "funds transfer" *smart contract* one time over the **Ethereum** network.

(Not counting the time it takes just to figure out the cost of doing so!)

## Coin Base

If you login to your *Coinbase Dashboard* over at [Coinbase dot com](https://medmj.us/SendEther){:title="Click to Visit your Coinbase Dashboard"}{:target="_blank"} using two-factor authentication, you will find the current price of one `ether` coin, or **ETH**.

One **ETH** is currently trading for around $730 USD.

Now, divide $730 USD by 1,000 *zillion* `wei` and you fill find the current price of one `wei`.

And, remember ... we need 420 billion `wei` to run our *smart contract* over at the **Ethereum** network.

**Hint**. One thousand zillion equals ... a trillion (`1,000,000,000,000`) plus another six (6) zeros, or ...


```liquid
{% raw %}
1,000,000,000,000,000,000
{% endraw %}
```

## Blockchain 3.0

Using the trusty, super-large *Web2* online calculator over at [Zero Calc dot com](https://web2.0calc.com/){:title="Click to Visit the Web2 Online Calculator at Zero Calc dot com"}{:target="_blank"} ...

We see one `wei` currently equals seventy-three hundred zillionths of one `dollar` (USD), or ...

```liquid
{% raw %}
0.00000000000000073 USD
{% endraw %}
```

Now, if we multiply the current value of one `wei` in **USD** by our requirement of four-hundred twenty billion `wei` (just to run our transfer contract over at the Ethereum network) ...

```liquid
{% raw %}
420,000,000,000 wei
{% endraw %}
```

Then, we get a total cost per transfer of `$0.0003066`, which is still currently less than one-penny (USD).

Fill 'er up!
